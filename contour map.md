# Contour Maps
Let $f$ : $D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function
- A level set of $f$ is the set of points in $D$ so the output of $f$ is $c$
- A contour map is a plot in the domain of $f$ consisiting of evenly-spaced level sets

**Notice** the spacing between contour lines as it determines rate of change in one axis
