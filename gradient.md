# Gradient and Directional [[derivative]]
The gradient of $f(x,y)$ at the point $P$ is $$\nabla f_P=<f_x(P),f_y(P)>$$ , *which is a vector.*

The Chain Rule for $f(\vec{r}(t))$: If $f$ and $\vec{r}(t)$ are differentiable, then $$\frac{d}{dt} f(\vec{r}(t))=\nabla f_{\vec{r}(t)}*\vec{r}'(t)$$
The direction derivative of $f(x,y)$ at the point $P$ is the direction $\vec{u}$ is $$
D_{\vec{u}} f(P)=\left.\frac{d}{d t}\right|_{t=0} f\left(\vec{r}_0+t \vec{u}\right)= \nabla f_p \cdot \vec{u} 
$$
