- When solving for intersections of a line & plane or line & sphere, split up into x, y, z (paramaterize)
- Dot product for angle is $\cos{\theta}=\frac{v\cdot w}{\left|\left| v\right|\right|\left|\left|w\right|\right|}$
- ![[Pasted image 20220912211831.png]] The projection of AC on AD is just AD since they are orthogonal 
- $\vec{u}_{\parallel v}=(\frac{u\cdot v}{\left|\left|v\right|\right|^2})v$

- parallelepiped has volume of $(u \times v) \cdot w$
- triangle has volume of $\frac{1}{2}(u \times v)$
